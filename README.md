# HelloWorld

Come with me on my beginer bioinformatics adventure!

#ABOUT ME
I am a PhD student in Ontario, Canada
- interested in gene regulation and differential promoter activation 
- my lab studies the cellular response to oxygen and I am taking that interest to more of a transcriptional regulation direction

Let's get past the initial difficulties of learning to code!
and get one step closer to using all of the lost data available!

#GITHUB GOALS
  1) collab with other's bioinf codes
  2) Use GitHub as a cleaner storage of my own notes and scripts
    stay organized!

#THE PLAN
- I am a note taker. 
  - These will be over-detailed notes to help my learning process
  - great for newcomers like me!
- I'll be using this Github space to both test existing bioinf scripts/projects on my current data & make a simple pipline with my own scripts and the programs available through Compute Canada
  - more info of my pipline in Project1 repository

#GETTING STARTED
- I'll be using GitHub to save my work and collab with other's scripts
- My edits are made in VSCode
- I use the Compute Canada server
- I run either in my bash terminal or the VSCode terminal

#CONTACT ME!
- Science can be isolating - so let's take advantage of GitHub and avoid that!
- I love to collab! Hit me up with everything from tips or questions about my work or anything you want to share! Everyone loves to talk about themselves and I am all ears
